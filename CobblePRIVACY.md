Thank you for using **Cobble AI**. Your thoughts belong to you. This policy explains how we handle information inside the Cobble AI mobile application and within limited supporting services.

## 1. Guiding Principles
- **On-device first**: Thought data, journal entries, and action steps stay on your device by default.
- **Minimum collection**: We only request information needed to run the app and process subscriptions.
- **Transparency**: You can review, export, or delete your data at any time from within the app.

## 2. Information We Handle
### Information You Provide
- Optional profile details (nickname, email if you sign in)
- Thoughts, todos, and notes entered in the app
- Voice input captured for speech-to-text (processed locally on device)
